# To prevent constant password inputs, set it up this way:
# A is client, B is ssh server
a@A$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
# Save rsa file under /home/a/.ssh/ dir
Passphrase: <null>

# Make directory .ssh on server if not already existing:
a@A$ ssh b@B 'mkdir -p .ssh'
b@B pass:

# Append a's new public key to b@B: .ssh/authorized_keys
a@A$ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh b@B 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'

# You should be able to log into B without password.

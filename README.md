# i3 dotfiles
Hi, these are my dotfiles for both my main computer and secondary old netbook. Both computers work really well with this setup.

Here is how my setup looks:

All you need is hopefully in `acer/` or `miniacer/`, and there's a little bit of manuals / tutorials in the `configmanuals/` too!

Enjoy it and give me some new ideas if you want :D

### What did I use:
- WM: i3
- Bar: polybar (many thanks to [Tardog](https://github.com/Tardog/i3-dotfiles))
- Terminal: urxvt (Xresources themes: [logico-dev](https://github.com/logico-dev/Xresources-themes))
- Launcher: rofi
